# ZapRecall

## This project built using React is a flashcard game. User can select different decks and set hit goals!

## How it works

-   You must inform which deck you want to play with;
-   Then you inform a hit goal;
-   So all flash cards are shuffled and hidden;
-   When choosing a flashcard, a question will appear;
-   You must click on the arrow for the flash card to turn and then the answer will appear;
-   You must inform whether or not he remembered the answer;
-   At the end it is informed if he completed the goal or not.
